# To Do List Project

This is a simple To-Do list project that enables the user to interact with a webpage and perform simple CRUD functionality.  
This project allowed me to explore further technologies such as SpringBoot - as well as the front end tech with entails JavaScript and HTML.  
The project document folder contains my risk assessment, PPT, and certain relevant images  with repect to the project.  


## Getting Started

The below instructions will get you a version of the project up and running in a local environment for developing and testing purposes.  
1. clone and fork  
2. open in IDE as maven/spring prj  
3. Open CLI in the folder where the .jar file is located
4. Run the command `java -jar <filename>` and this should start up the tomcat server 
5. head over to `localhost:8080.index` for the landing page   
6. load up postman use the URLS to test the functionality is working  
7. you can also head to localhost:8080/h2-console to checkout the database
8. removing the h2-console from the url will take you to the index.html for the to do list
